# Week Seven

### What I learned
- Insight into how a testing framework works. One like Jasmine is made up of mountains over code, however at their basis they are quite simple. We were able to see they're made up of different functions.
- Saw the power of jQuery. We were not able to use it and instead just wrote the JS - meant a lot more code.

### What we built
- Our own testing framework. It's called Dave and we were able to build our own little bit of HTML for it.
- A single-page note app. Good insight into how web pages can be so dynamic.
