# Week Five

## Summary

### What I learned
- We moved onto JavaScript. This was a language I have used before, however the most hands-on approach to codecademy exercises proved trickier than I expected.
- I spent the bulk of the week researching the language. This included closures, lexical environment, callbacks and more.
- Despite following the resources I was reading, I struggled to pick up on these new concepts in the weekly challenges. I'm trying to go through the bowling challenge to put this into practice.
- On Friday, we were given the challenge of doing FizzBuzz in a new language. Stemmed from interest, I chose Golang. I was able to write both the tests and the code to pass.

### What I built
- I completed the week's challenges: airport and thermostat.
- Tried doing the bowling challenge over the weekend and struggled. Hoping to build on this in week six.
