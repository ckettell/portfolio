# Week Six

## Goals
- This week I'm doing the AirBnB challenge with Tim, Marvin and Harry.
- In terms of tech, we will be using an ORM for the first time. We have chosen Active Record.
- I'm hoping to improve my communication skills when using JS.

## What we built
- This was quite a busy week. We built a mock Air BnB.
- We tried to make this a bit of a challenge for ourselves. We used JS as the model but insisted on using an ORM. We did find by doing this we were required to mirror the work we were doing on the frontend.
